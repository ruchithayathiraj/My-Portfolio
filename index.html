                            Hello, I'm Ruchitha Yathirajulu, currently based in Ottawa, Ontario. I am a dedicated and versatile engineer with a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Ottawa, expected to graduate in April 2025. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Visveswaraya Technological University, India.<br /><br />

                            I am currently a Student Intern in Autonomous Driving Systems at Aurrigo Canada Limited, actively involved in installing and configuring radar sensors on autonomous vehicles. Proficient in C++, Linux, Python, and more, I contribute to data collection, analysis, and visualization, emphasizing multiple vehicle target detection and addressing field of view challenges.<br /><br />

                            In addition to my technical endeavors, I am actively engaged in professional development as a student member of the Professional Development Club, working under the Career Development Center. In this role, I assist students by conducting mock interviews, filtering resumes for clients, and providing career advice through LinkedIn and resume reviews.<br /><br />

                            I also serve as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Ottawa, conducting hands-on lab sessions and tutoring students in engineering design processes and advance programming concepts in C++. My diverse skill set includes Onshape, AutoCAD, Arduino, Unity, MATLAB, and more.<br /><br />

                            Previously, at Sonata Software Private Limited, I worked as a Digital Engineer, gaining expertise in T-SQL, database development, ETL tasks, and data management tools. I successfully orchestrated tasks interfacing MS SQL Server, Snowflake, and ETL tools, resulting in a 25% speedup in data processing. Proficient in R, T-SQL/SQL, Tableau, and more, I collaborated on enhancing SSRS and Excel reports, utilizing Azure DevOps Server for efficient project management.<br /><br />

                            As a Student Intern at Unique Tech Designs, I acquired hands-on experience in Embedded Systems, IoT Technologies, PCB Design, and 3D Printing. My passion for innovation is reflected in projects like the Obstacle Detecting Robot, Solar Energy for RPI in Remote Areas, and the Bluetooth Controlled Robot, showcasing my commitment to AI, energy efficiency, and IoT principles.<br /><br />

                            My journey is defined by a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies, problem-solving, and a dedication to sustainable and innovative solutions. I am excited about contributing my skills to impactful projects and continuing my journey in pushing the boundaries of technology and design. </p>
